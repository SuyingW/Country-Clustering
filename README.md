# Country-Clustering

The goal of this project is to find out which countries are urgently in need of help. The dataset is from Help International, an international humanitarian NGO that is aiming at alleviating poverty and helping people of developing countries. In this project, I use K-means clustering to categorize countries based on socio-economic and health indicators. 

I use the following variables from the dataset for clustering:
- child_mort: death of children under 5 years of age per 1000 live births
- exports: exports of goods and services per capita (percentage of the DGP per capita)
- health: total health spending per capita (percentage of GDP per capita)
- imports: imports of goods and services per capita 
- income: net income per person
- inflation: annual growth rate of the total GDP
- life_expec: life expectancy, the average of year a person can live
- total_fer: average number of children a female give birth to.
- gdpp: The GDP per capita.
